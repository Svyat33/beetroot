"""
Task 1

The greeting program.

Make a program that has your name and the current day of the week stored as separate variables and then prints a message
like this:

     "Good day <name>! <day> is a perfect day to learn some python."
Note that  <name> and <day> are predefined variables in source code.

An additional bonus will be to use different string formatting methods for constructing result string.
"""

name = "Vladyslav"
day = "Sunday"
print(f"Good day {name}! {day} is a perfect day to learn some python.")



"""
Task 2

first_name = "Vladyslav"
last_name = "Zabudskyi"
